# DATASCI 200: Intro to Data Science Programming
## UC Berkeley School for Information
## Final Project 

This repository contains the collaborative project work of Aashray Puri, Isaac Madera, and Raymond Hung. , centered on comprehending domestic flight patterns within the US airline industry. Enclosed within are assorted Jupyter notebooks, datasets, code implementations, and documentation reflecting our combined exploration of various visualization techniques, methodologies, and the extraction of insightful conclusions.

### US Domestic Air Travel Trends & Data Analysis
This study utilizes pre-trained LLMs to generate headlines from social media posts, emphasizing accuracy and engagement. By employing models like PEGASUS, T5, and BART on Reddit data, we aim to preserve semantic content while enhancing summarization. Evaluation metrics, including ROUGE, BLEU, and semantic similarity scores, alongside human feedback, highlight the T5 model's superior performance. Despite computational constraints and model-specific challenges, our research underscores the importance of innovative approaches to evaluation of headline generation from user-generated content.
